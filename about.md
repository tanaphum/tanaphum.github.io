The Mathematical and Economic MODelling (MAEMOD) Department’s main research focus is mathematical and economic models for the transmission, control and elimination of tropical diseases. Because of its position in a tropical medicine research unit serving South-East Asia, MAEMOD’s work is closely integrated with other disciplines. This results in research that is highly pragmatic and data-driven, often involving dynamic interplay with experiments and field research.

The work of [MORU](http://www.tropmedres.ac)’s Mathematical and Economic Modelling Department (MAEMOD) was recently featured in a [video on SciDevNet](http://www.scidev.net/global/malaria/multimedia/maths-weapon-against-malaria.html)

MAEMOD also coordinates an international network of infectious disease modellers and modelling research beneficiaries working in the Tropics ([TDModNet](http://www.tdmod.net/)). 

Three groups sit within MAEMOD:

- **[The Economics and Translational Research Group (ETRG)](http://www.tropmedres.ac/the-economics-and-translational-research-group-etrg)** focuses on the impact and cost-effectiveness of new interventions when introduced in real-life settings, utilising approaches ranging from early stage modelling through qualitative research, to pragmatic clinical trials. The team includes health economists, social scientists and clinician-researchers.
- **[The Bacterial Resistance Analysis Group (BRAG)](http://www.tropmedres.ac/about-the-bacterial-resistance-analysis-group-brag)** investigates bacterial-resistant infections primarily in Southeast Asia using cross-cutting research techniques.
- **The neglected tropical diseases modelling group** led by Wirichada Pan-ngum focuses on regional health problems, mostly neglected tropical diseases such as leptospirosis, melioidosis, dengue, and tuberculosis. The modelling approach is used to explore some specific issues that may become relevant to infectious diseases including aging populations, health attitudes and practices, chronic infections such as diabetes, climate change, life style and urbanization. The team combines modelling with community health research, population surveys and qualitative studies. They use surveys to refine their research questions and plan for effective implementation of new interventions. A key aim is to build capacity within the group with the training of new modellers, and a long-term goal is to create a modelling network in Southeast Asia.

# post-doc post based in Oxford: statistical/mathematical modeller to work on developing and evaluating novel adaptive trial designs for evaluating vaccines in infectious disease emergencies.

We have an Oxford-based post-doc post for a statistical/mathematical modeller to work on developing and evaluating novel adaptive trial designs for evaluating vaccines in infectious disease emergencies.

Working with me, Peter Horby + collaborating with Harvard (Marc Lipsitch & Bill Hanage) and Cambridge (Daniela De Angelis & Anne Presanis).

Please forward to anyone you know who you think might be interested
